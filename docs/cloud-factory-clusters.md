# Cloud-Linked Factory Clusters

## Overview
Chunks scattered across the world contain dormant factory objects—resource nodes, smelters, constructors, logistics pylons, and more. Each chunk is a mini-biome with its own environmental quirks, resource compositions, and ambient threats. When a faction's expeditionary drone discovers a factory object, the object is authenticated and paired with the faction's cloud factory cluster. From that point onward, the object becomes a remote endpoint that can be orchestrated and monitored from the faction's command interface, no matter where the players are physically located.

The cloud cluster acts as a teleportation-grade logistics backbone. Resources harvested by a node are disassembled into energy-encoded packets, routed through the cloud lattice, and reconstituted at any subscribed factory endpoint. This allows players to weave production chains that span continents without laying traditional belts. Spatial separation becomes an opportunity rather than a constraint.

## Discovery and Claiming
- **Survey Drones:** Autonomous drones scout nearby chunks, mapping both geography and signal signatures that hint at dormant factory objects. Drones can be upgraded with better scanners, stealth fields, or environmental resistance to handle hazardous zones.
- **First Contact Protocols:** Upon finding an object, factions must solve a quick systems puzzle—rerouting power, matching resonance keys, or defeating guarding fauna. Success links the object to the cloud. Failure might trigger defenses or leave the object open for rival factions.
- **Shared or Contested Ownership:** Objects can be flagged as public, private, or competitive. Public objects allow cooperative use; competitive ones create tug-of-war scenarios where factions push influence via maintenance crews or sabotage bots.

## Cloud Logistics Mechanics
- **Teleportation Channels:** Each linked object exposes multiple channels. Channels can be configured for different resource types or power throughput, encouraging specialization.
- **Latency and Bandwidth:** While teleportation is instantaneous, throughput is capped by the object's upgrade tier. Overloading a channel introduces delay, encouraging players to invest in parallel links or channel amplifiers.
- **Cloud Buffers:** Temporary storage hubs in the cloud absorb fluctuations. Players can configure buffer priorities (e.g., keep at least 200 ingots on reserve for emergency builds) and schedule shipments for synchronized crafting bursts.
- **Routing Scripts:** Simple node-based scripting lets players define conditional flows—"if copper ingots > 500, redirect to electronics constructors"—enabling responsive automation without complex coding.

## Factory Object Diversity
- **Resource Nodes:** Adaptive drill heads that change mode based on the mineral composition, extracting trace elements as bonuses when matched with the right analyzer modules.
- **Smelters and Refiners:** Modular furnaces that accept attachable coils, filters, and catalysts. Attachments alter recipes, unlock cleaner processing, or generate exotic byproducts used for high-tier tech.
- **Constructors:** Multi-bay assembly platforms capable of simultaneous recipe batches. Players can schedule production cycles, assign AI assemblers, and queue custom prototypes discovered through exploration.
- **Bio-Assemblers:** Located in lush chunks, these vats grow organic components—living circuit boards, self-healing armor—requiring a balance of nutrients teleported from agri-nodes.
- **Quantum Lighthouses:** Strategic structures that extend the cloud's reach into storm-shrouded regions, acting as both map beacons and fast-travel anchors.

## Keeping Gameplay Dynamic
- **Chunk Events:** Chunks occasionally shift states—meteor showers, migrating wildlife, or resource surges—that modify production efficiency. Factions monitor alerts and redeploy resources to capitalize or defend.
- **Faction Objectives:** Daily cloud contracts encourage varied play: stabilize a smelter under sandstorm assault, deliver precision parts to a distant constructor chain, or rewire a node to purify toxic ore.
- **Mobile Factories:** Deployable walkers combine harvesting, processing, and teleportation into nomadic rigs. They can temporarily link to the cloud, acting as pop-up supply depots during expeditions.
- **Inter-Faction Trade:** Players can lease channel capacity or license recipes. Reputation systems track reliability, unlocking shared mega-projects like orbital elevators or planetary shields.
- **Security Intrigue:** Saboteurs can infiltrate cloud links with virus payloads, forcing players to maintain firewalls, redundancy networks, and rapid-response repair teams.

## Progression and Mastery
- **Tech Tree Synergy:** Upgrades require artifacts found in rare chunks, encouraging exploration. Milestones unlock advanced cloud algorithms, increase teleportation efficiency, and grant AI overseers for micro-optimization.
- **Story Arcs:** Narrative threads revolve around uncovering who built the original cloud lattice, why certain chunks are quarantined, and how awakening ancient factory minds might reshape faction alliances.
- **Endgame Projects:** Massive constructs—sky platforms, terraforming engines, dimension bridges—demand coordination across dozens of objects. Success visibly reshapes the world, offering prestige and mechanical perks.

## Player Experience Goals
- **Freedom of Layout:** By decoupling logistics from geography, players focus on creative production chains and strategic positioning rather than grindy transport.
- **Meaningful Exploration:** Every chunk can house unique factory objects or lore, rewarding curiosity with tangible mechanical benefits.
- **Collaborative Depth:** Cloud-linked objects make it easy for friends or allied factions to contribute, while competitive mechanics keep tension alive.
- **Replayability:** Procedural chunk generation, dynamic events, and evolving cloud tech ensure that each campaign feels fresh and full of discovery.

The cloud factory cluster transforms the world into an interlinked sandbox where ingenuity, exploration, and diplomacy define success.
