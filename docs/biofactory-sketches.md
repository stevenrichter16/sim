# Biofactory Pencil Sketches

The following quick pencil-style sketches capture the mood of the new biological factory set pieces. Each was scribbled to evoke graphite shading, irregular organic silhouettes, and the eerie tenderness of the refit.

A pulsating mound of cultured tissue swaddled in shading, waiting for a harvest surgeon to carefully slice away a new skin patch.

Layered graphite strokes hint at glass and metal, while the downward shading suggests warm, swirling bio-slurry condensing into body systems.

The rounded frame resembles an incubator cradle, sketched with overlapping pencil lines that reinforce the gentle curvature used to assemble a new faction member.

This capsule, shaded lightly around the rim, represents the circulatory lattice that the Bioforge Vat extrudes from blood vials.
